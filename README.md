# Bible Versions plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)

Displays parallel bible versions in the right sidebar for a selected scripture reference, fetched from BibleGateway.com.


# How to Install

Download the latest **bible-versions** [release](https://github.com/MrBertie/bible-versions/releases), unzip it, and drop the folder into your `{Obsidian Vault}/.obsidian/plugins` folder.  Edit the plugin folder name to remove the version number, e.g. `-v.0.1.1`, and then restart Obsidian.
You will need to go to the *Plugin Settings* page in Obsidian and enable the plugin.

⚠️ IMPORTANT: the **jwl-linker** plugin is a required dependency and must be installed for this plugin to work. *(It is used to recognise and validate the scripture references.)*


# How to Use

Place the cursor in a bible scripture reference anywhere in a note and then click the `Find scripture at cursor` button beside the search box to look on [Bible Gateway](https://biblegateway.com).  If a match is found then all available bible versions for that verse will be listed in the sidebar.

You can also type the scripture reference into the search box directly and press `Enter`.  

> Most of the common scripture reference abbreviations and styles are recognised.  For example: `Rom 1:20; Psalm 89:18; 1 Cor 9:26; 1Jo 2:15-17`

**Reset search.**  Click to the clear search box `x` to reset the display.

**Copying the result.**  Click on a verse text in the sidebar to copy it to the clipboard.
