# How to Install

Download the [latest version](https://github.com/MrBertie/bible-versions/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) from this link, and unzip it.  
You see a folder called `bible-versions-main`; rename this folder as `bible-versions` and then add it into your `{Obsidian Vault}/.obsidian/plugins` folder.  
Restart Obsidian and go to the *Community Plugins Settings* page to enable the plugin.

*Note: you can also click the `<>Code` button above and choose `Download.zip`*

⚠️ IMPORTANT: the **jwl-linker** plugin is a required dependency and must be installed for this plugin to work. *(It is used to recognise and validate the scripture references.)*


# How to Use

Place the cursor in a bible scripture reference anywhere in a note and then click the `Find scripture at cursor` button beside the search box to look on [Bible Gateway](https://biblegateway.com).  If a match is found then all available bible versions for that verse will be listed in the sidebar.

You can also type the scripture reference into the search box directly and press `Enter`.  

> Most of the common scripture reference abbreviations and styles are recognised.  For example: `Rom 1:20; Psalm 89:18; 1 Cor 9:26; 1Jo 2:15`
